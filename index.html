                    Hello, my name is Journey! I have worked in may different industries such as Healthcare, Fast Food, Distrabution centers as well as a few Retail industries! Throughout my working career I have had six years of customer service experience which has brought me skills in bank deposits, Microsoft experience, Cash handling, management experience, Team Leadership, Management experience, team work, and store meetings.
                </p>
                <p> While I love woking I also enjoy a few hobbies outside of the work enviornment such as, staying active, reading a good book, catch up on the world news, and spending time with family! I believe that it is good practice to have your work and life well balanced!
                </p>
